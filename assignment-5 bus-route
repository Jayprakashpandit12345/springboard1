'''
The road transport corporation (RTC) of a city wants to know whether a particular bus-route is running on profit or loss.
Assume that the following information are given:
Price per litre of fuel = 70
Mileage of the bus in km/litre of fuel = 10
Price(Rs) per ticket = 80
The bus runs on multiple routes having different distance in kms and number of passengers.
Write a function to calculate and return the profit earned (Rs) in each route. Return -1 in case of loss.

def calculate(distance,no_of_passengers):
    Mileage=10
    Price_of_fuel = 70
    profit=0
    per_ticket = 80
    no_of_litre=distance/Mileage
    total_fule_cost=no_of_litre*Price_of_fuel
    total_ticket=no_of_passengers*per_ticket
    if(total_ticket>total_fule_cost):
        profit=total_ticket-total_fule_cost
        return profit
    else:
        return -1
